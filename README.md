## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this project, I used `Styled Components` to style the project. It was overwhelming at first and I didn't know how to structure my styled components. I enjoyed using `Styled Components` because it can be flexbile.

### Continued development

In my following projects, I want to use more of react advance concepts, get to know it more and be comfotable with it.

### Useful resources

- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - this documentation of styled-components helped me a lot and I will plan to use it more in my following projects
